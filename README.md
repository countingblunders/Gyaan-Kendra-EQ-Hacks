# Gyaan Kendra
Gyaan Kendra is a vision to help students with financial difficulties by providing education for free. <br>
Both 'Gyaan' and 'Kendra' are hindi words which mean **knowledge** and **point** respectively.

This Project is being undertaken by **@countingblunders** as a part of EQ-Hacks Hackathon

## Inspiration:
I have drawn the inspiration for this project from people I have seen who are often held back by the chains of financial liabilities which limit their true potential.

## How I built it
Mainly Tailwind and Tailblocks have been used for the creation of Gyaan Kendra Platform.

## Challenges I ran into
The main challenge I faced was the short duration in which I had to create the project within the limited time period which for me was around 1 week  since I had been busy. That was the reason I decided to use a framwork like Tailwind to create the project within the limited timeframe.

## What I learned
Throughout the building of this site, I learnt to deal with various challenges which helped me to develop my creativity and coding skills.

## What's next for Gyaan Kendra
I am eager to utilise the lessons learnt during the creation of this project in the future updates of Gyaan Kendra. I yearn for constant improvement in the future as well.

We'll most probably be adding notes of class 9th and class 10th CBSE to help the students revise their lessons quickly.
